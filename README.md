**# phonebook.py**

A simple command-line phonebook built in Python that lets you add, view, search, and delete contacts.
Contacts are saved in a JSON file so they persist even after closing the program.

**Features**
 Add a new contact (Name + Phone number)
 View all saved contacts
 Search contacts by name
 Delete contacts
Auto-save contacts to a JSON file

**How it Works**
When you start the app, it loads existing contacts from phonebook.json.

You can perform add, search, view, delete operations.

When you exit, it saves all changes into phonebook.json.

Phonebook Menu:
1️⃣ Add Contact
2️⃣ View Contacts
3️⃣ Search Contact
4️⃣ Delete Contact
5️⃣ Save & Exit

phonebook.py → Main program

phonebook.json → Stores contacts (auto-created)
